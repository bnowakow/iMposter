# iMposter
Project iMposter is part of master thesis. Video presents demo application for 3D gesture recognition performed in real time using prime-sense sensor.  
Presented framework provides efficient gesture recognition that uses HMM aided teaching algorithm and involves small amount of teaching data needed: 3 gestures required 20 recorded sequences (with 20 points each).
